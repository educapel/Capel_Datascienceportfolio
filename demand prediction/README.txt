Abstractâ€” The changing environment has led to challenges in the retail sector, particularly in managing the delicate equilibrium between supply, demand, and customer preferences. Retailers face the challenge of managing inventory levels and trying to understand their customers purchasing behaviors. Stock-outs and excess of stock levels lead to significant financial implications and therefore the issues become a crucial matter in the retail sector.
This study leverages data from UCI Machine Learning repository, analyzing transactions of customers from 2011 to enhance demand forecasting, evaluating variable effects on demand, and trying to find hidden customer behaviors within the data. Revealing insights of buying patterns and demographics, can guide retailers to adapt their strategies to meet evolving market demands. It also assesses the effectiveness of linear regression and XGBoost models to forecast future demand, provide actionable solutions for the retail market to navigate through different challenges.
