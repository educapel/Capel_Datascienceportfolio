My name is Eduardo Capel, I'm 22 and I'm currently a data science student at Nucleo Digital School.
 
So far, I've studied Business Management in the University of Murcia, doing a year abroad in Newcastle University, academic year 2021/2022. Thanks to my degree I've been able to acquire knowledge in Econometrics, Statistics working with programmes such as Eviews and R studio. In addition to this, during my four years of business management degree I also started to be interested in data and how to work with it, so in 2019 I took an advanced course in data analysis and management and business intelligence with excel provided by the University of Murcia. This has meant my kick-off point to start learning Data Science.
 
In this Github profile it will be posted different projects of Data science where my skills will be shown.
