My name is Eduardo Capel, I'm 22 and I'm currently a data science student at Nucleo Digital School.
 
So far, I've studied Business Management in the University of Murcia, doing a year abroad in Newcastle University, academic year 2021/2022. Thanks to my degree I've been able to acquire knowledge in Econometrics and Statistics and in addition to this, during my degree I started to be interested in the data, taking courses provided by my University in 2019. This has meant my kick-off point to start learning Data Science.
 
In this Github profile it will be posted different projects of Data science where my skills will be shown.
