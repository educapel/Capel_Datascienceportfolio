My name is Eduardo Capel, I´m 22 and I'm currently a datascience student at Nuclio Digital School.

So far, I´ve studied Business Managament in the University of Murcia, doing a year abroad in Newcastle University, academic year 2021/2022. Thanks to my degree I've be able to acquire knowledge in Econometrics and Statistics. This have meant my kick-off point to start learning Data Science.

In this Github profile it will be posted different projects of Data science where my skills will be shown.
