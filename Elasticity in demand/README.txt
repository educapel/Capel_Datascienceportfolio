This study explores optimal pricing strategies for an online retailer aiming to maximize expected revenue in the face of uncertain future demand. Focused on a replenishable product whose demand is price-sensitive, the research delves into devising a dynamic pricing policy over a fixed period. A sophisticated system is developed to analyze the relationship between retail price and demand, enabling precise demand function estimation.

The core of the study involves predicting demand and revenue for various retail prices. The research problem is framed as a revenue maximization challenge within a discrete finite time frame, utilizing discrete retail price levels. An optimal pricing policy is derived based on these predictions, leveraging computational experiments to observe the policy’s impact on inventory management.

Key areas of focus include price elasticity of demand and various demand models, extended to incorporate factors like market value and demand autoregressive effects. The study also touches on the elasticity-based demand forecasting system, which enhances the retailer’s grasp on demand uncertainty.

The research further navigates through the complexities of revenue optimization in retail pricing, tackling issues like inventory management and the sell-through rate. The final objective is a well-informed, data-driven pricing strategy that not only boosts revenue but also aligns with market dynamics and consumer behavior.
