I recently completed a data science project focused on the real estate market in Alicante, Spain. The objective of this project was to gather, process, and model real estate data to predict property prices in the region. Let me walk you through the key steps of the project:

#Step 1: Web Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup

In the initial phase of the project, I used web scraping techniques with Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract valuable real estate data from Idealista, one of the largest and most influential real estate companies in Spain. The data extraction involved crucial information, particularly property IDs and postal codes. This information laid the foundation for the subsequent analysis.

#Step 2: Data Transformation with ast.literal_eval and Regex

The data retrieved from the web was initially in a text format, which needed significant transformation. I employed Python's ast.literal_eval function and regular expressions (regex) to structure the raw text data into a more organized format. This transformation process included converting text data into categorical, boolean, and numerical variables. It was a critical step to ensure that the data was suitable for building a predictive model.

#Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing was an essential part of the project. It involved cleaning, and preprocessing the data to prepare it for modeling. Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring that all variables were in a consistent format were some of the tasks in this phase.

#Step 4: Model Building with Ridge Regression

For the predictive modeling part, I implemented a machine learning pipeline. The pipeline included column transformers to handle different types of variables and a Ridge Regression model. Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that's particularly useful for recognizing patterns in the data and making price predictions. This model was chosen for its ability to handle multicollinearity and produce stable predictions.

#Challenges Faced

One notable challenge in this project was related to older properties with fluctuating prices. Due to variations in property values over time, it was often challenging to find reliable price data for such properties. This issue is common in real estate analysis and required careful consideration.

In conclusion, this real estate project in Alicante, Spain was a comprehensive undertaking that involved web scraping, data transformation, preprocessing, and machine learning modeling. The ultimate goal was to provide valuable insights and predictions related to property prices in the region, a task that required careful handling of data and the application of advanced analytical techniques.

The insights gained from this project can be invaluable for real estate investors, buyers, and sellers in Alicante, Spain, providing them with data-driven guidance for their decisions in the local real estate market.
